Fetches the 'PREDICTS' database and relevant metadata from the Data
Portal at the Natural History Museum, London <https://data.nhm.ac.uk>.
Data were collated from over 400 existing spatial comparisons of
local-scale biodiversity exposed to different intensities and types of
anthropogenic pressures, from sites around the world. These data are
described in Hudson et al. (2013)
